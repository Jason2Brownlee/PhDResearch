<h3><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: 400">As apart of the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060821060043/http://www.wcci2006.org/">IEEE World Congress on Computational 
Intelligence conference</a> 2006, specifically the Congress on Evolutionary 
Computation (CEC 2006), a number of competitions are held for computational 
intelligence algorithms (see the competition pages
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060821060043/http://www.wcci2006.org/WCCI-Web_CompetitionProgram.html">here</a> and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060821060043/http://www.hi.is/~tpr/cec2006contests/">here</a>). One competition that 
caught my interest was the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060821060043/http://gungurru.csse.uwa.edu.au/cara/huygens/">Huygens Probe 
Competition</a> in which algorithms are tested and compete on a number of 
black-box function optimisation problems. The clincher is that for each test 
problem the algorithm is exposed to only 1000 function evaluations are 
permitted, thus the problem of exploration and exploitation must be very 
carefully managed under this constraint of limited evaluations. For a complete 
description of the competition see
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060821060043/http://gungurru.csse.uwa.edu.au/cara/huygens/cec2006.php">here</a>.</span></font></h3>
 
<p> 

<font size="4" color="#000080"><b>Software</b></font></p>
 
<h3><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The first thing I did for this 
competition was build a framework that would support a stack of standard 
off-line test problems and algorithms. The result was this
<a href="/web/20060821060043/http://ict.swin.edu.au/personal/jbrownlee/funcopt/index.htm">function optimization software</a> (14 
algorithms, 30 problems, free source code, written in Java, etc.). </span>
</font></h3>
 
<p>The second thing I did was write a test harness that would provide consistent 
benchmark results. The result is the free software provided on this page that 
permits <i><b>any novice or expert computational intelligence practitioner to 
get involved in the competition without writing having to write a line of code</b></i>.</p>
 
<p>The software uses the HTTP interface for the competition for function 
evaluations, and supports all of the algorithms supported by the afore mentioned 
function optimisation software as well as any additional third-party algorithms 
added to the framework. The software was written for speed, and supports 
batch-HTTP evaluations using a multithreaded evaluation engine (up to 50 
simultaneous evaluations), which if improperly configured could cause harm to 
the competition evaluation server (so handle with care please). The software 
also supports proxy configuration and <u>it should be noted</u> is configured by 
default for the Swinburne University network proxy (non-Swinburne uses can 
simply change the properties file). A properties file is provided &quot;<i>huygens.properties</i>&quot; 
to configure all meaningful aspects of the client software. User login 
information for the competition is entered in to the software at runtime as a 
property of the problem. Graphs, and sample plots are provided to assist in 
tuning selected algorithms. Further, the software is written as a modular 
framework meaning that it is trivial to write alternative interfaces for batch 
runs or any other desired usage.</p>
 
<p>The software supports three problem modes as follows:</p>
 
    <ol>
      <li><b>Huygens Any Moon</b> - Used for one-off algorithm tests. The user 
      enters their login details and the moon they want to test against. The 
      number of evaluations the can be reduced from 1000 for rapid proof of 
      concept testing. </li>
      <li><b>Internal Benchmark</b> - A benchmark interface is provided that 
      captures test results across multiple moons and with multiple repetitions. 
      A configured algorithm is evaluated on the first 10 moons (20_1 to 20_10). 
      Benchmark results can be exported as csv (excel format) for offline 
      algorithm comparison. This mode was invented for offline benchmarking 
      using the single-moon training interface provided by the competition such 
      that results would not be entered into the league table. It provides a 
      means of comparing competitive algorithms &quot;internally&quot; before exposing 
      results to the world via the server benchmark - very useful indeed for my 
      own testing!</li>
      <li><b>Server Benchmark</b> - This mode will test a configured algorithm 
      on 10 unknown moons selected by the competition server, and results are 
      entered in to the league table
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060821060043/http://gungurru.csse.uwa.edu.au/cara/huygens/leagueTables.php">
      here</a>. Progress bars are provided for user feedback of benchmark 
      status.</li>
    </ol>
 
<p><i>Why release this software before the competition opens?</i> Well I just 
like sharing, and I'm interested in third-party algorithm contributions or 
interesting algorithm configurations, so please contact me and tell me how you 
are using this software or framework? All comments and features requests can be directed to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060821060043/http://www.ict.swin.edu.au/ictstaff/jbrownlee/">me</a>.</p>
 
<p>Enjoy.</p>
