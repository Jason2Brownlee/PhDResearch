<font size="4" color="#000080"><b>Overview</b></font></p>
 
<h3><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: 400">I am interested in human 
interacting during the optimisation process. This was a part of my thinking 
behind the development of <a href="/web/20060821063258/http://ict.swin.edu.au/personal/jbrownlee/iidle/index.htm">IIDLE</a>. In particular 
I am interested in the user as an pattern matching objective function, moreover 
I am interested in investigating the effects of the collaboration between many 
users as objective functions in optimisation tasks. I believe that

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060821063258/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_genetic_algorithm">interactive 
genetic algorithm</a> can be used for more than aesthetic optimisation as in the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060821063258/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Watchmaker">blind watchmaker</a> 
example (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060821063258/http://physics.syr.edu/courses/mirror/biomorph/">see here</a>), 
that it can be used effectively to assist an automated search process 
(algorithm), especially on a large distributed scale. Not a new idea, but I am 
still trying to wrap my head around it.</span></font></h3>
 
<p> 

<font size="4" color="#000080"><b>Software</b></font></p>
 
<p>I have prepared some simple software to explore some ideas on 
human-interactive optimisation which is really nothing more than a greatly 
simplified version of the human-interactive TSP example in IIDLE. The software 
provides a number of simple polygon coverage problems. In these problems the 
user must guide a simple random search algorithm to cover the red polygons 
(problem definition) with green polygons (solution). A simple blind watchmaker 
interface is provided where the user subjectively selects the &quot;best&quot; solution 
which is then copied into the top left square, and all remaining squares are 
filled with variations of the selected solution. The user is given control over 
the number of solutions displayed during the optimisation process, the problem 
definition and the amount of mutation performed each algorithm step.</p>
 
<p>As mentioned, it is a first approach, and although it is possible for the 
user to guide the optimization process to a passable solution, it is less than 
efficient and in some cases boring for the user. I do believe that the 
principles are good, and although the process would be enhanced by more 
effective user-controls, I think simplicity of the interface is the key to this 
puzzle. I am still seeking a good application or approach, so if you have any 
ideas or related references contact me, otherwise have a play with the applet.</p>
 
<p>The software is written in Java and is provided for <i>free</i>. It can be 
accessed from within a browser as an applet, as a standalone application, and 
the source code is provided. An simple software architecture has been 
implemented permitting the easy inclusion of additional algorithms and test 
problem domains.</p>
 
<p><font size="4">The most recent version of the <b>applet</b> can be 
accessed <a href="version1.0/applet.html">here</a></font></p>

<p>The following are features I would like to add to this software over time, as 
well as user-requested features that I'd like to include (time permitting):</p>
 
      <ul>
        <li>Perhaps permit the algorithm to determine the number and type of 
        polygons in the scene rather than providing it with these problem 
        specific details - it would make a hard problem for the system to 
        address</li>
