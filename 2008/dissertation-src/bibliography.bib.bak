	survival. In this context the conflict of survival interests between
	the diverse B cells gives rise to a pattern of interactions which
	mimics the behavior of complex ecological systems. In response to
	competition lymphocytes modify their survival requirements and diverge
	to occupy different immunological niches through differentiation.
	Thus naive and memory-activated B cell populations show independent
	homeostatic regulation. We discuss how niche differentiation allows
	the coexistence of different cell types and guarantees both repertoire
	diversity and efficient immune responses.},

  abstract = {We investigate the evolution of viral strategies to counteract immunological
	attack. These strategies can be divided into two classes: those that
	impair the immune response inside or at the surface of a virus-infected
	cell and those that impair the immune response outside an infected
	cell. The former strategies confer a "selfish" individual selective
	advantage for intra-host competition among viruses. The latter strategies
	confer an "unselfish" selective advantage to the virus population
	as a group. A mutant, defective in the gene coding for the extracellular
	immune function-impairment strategy, may be protected from immune
	attack because the wild-type virus in the same host successfully
	impairs the host's immune function. Such "unselfish" defense strategies
	are neutral with respect to intra-host competition. We present simple
	models of viral intra-host and combined inter- and intra-host evolution.
	We show that selfish strategies can evolve by intra-host evolution.
	Unselfish strategies may evolve if inter-host selection pressures
	outweigh intra-host selection, suggesting that such strategies can
	only evolve in viruses with low mutation rates.},

	problem solving can solve a task faster than either a single agent
	or the same group of agents working in isolation from each other.
	Nevertheless, little is known about the quantitative improvements
	that result from cooperation. A number of experimental results are
	presented on constraint satisfaction that both test the predictions
	of a theory of cooperative problem solving and assess the value of
	cooperation for this class of problems. These experiments suggest
	an alternative methodology to existing techniques for solving constraint
	satisfaction problems in computer science and distributed artificial
	intelligence.},

  abstract = {This article continues the ongoing debate around models of the immune
	system. Earlier contributors have paid much attention to the various
	processes that lead to adaptive immune system aggression or tolerance.
	They have often based their discussions around facts that have been
	established by experimental investigation. However, both the observation
	and interpretation of these facts have been influenced by the function--or
	system goal--that is believed to have generated them. The perception
	of this function (of all or part of the immune system) is influenced
	by long established theories in immunology (e.g. horror autotoxicus,
	clonal deletion in utero, pathogen elimination, clonal selection,
	auto-immunity and so on) which, for many, have become enshrined as
	facts. One function that has had less consideration and has not been
	extensively investigated is the maintenance of tissue homeostasis.
	When the immune system is viewed from this perspective, the facts
	invite alternative interpretations. Whilst this perspective may not
	necessarily be the only valid one, let alone a correct one, viewing
	things this way--at least briefly--might help to expose hidden assumptions.
	It also emphasizes that the immune system is a system and, as such,
	it can by analysed through the principles of general systems theory.},

  year = {2000},

  abstract = {In this essay we suggest that the primary goal of the cells of the
	immune system is to ensure their own growth and survival. In adults,
	in steady-state conditions, the number and distribution of lymphocyte
	populations is under homeostatic control. New lymphocytes that are
	continuously produced in primary and secondary lymphoid organs must
	compete with resident cells for survival. We discuss recent findings
	supporting lymphocyte survival as a continuous active process and
	implicating cognate receptor engagement as fundamental survival signals
	for both T and B lymphocytes. The conflict of survival interests
	between different cell types gives rise to a pattern of interactions
	that mimics the behavior of complex ecological systems. In their
	flight for survival and in response to competition, lymphocytes use
	different survival signals within different ecological niches during
	cell differentiation. This is the case for T and B lymphocytes and
	also for naive and memory/activated T and B cells. We discuss how
	niche differentiation allows the co-existence of different cell types
	and guarantees both repertoire diversity and efficient immune responses.},

	lineages may be recombined into a single lineage. In asexual populations,
	however, clones that carry such alternative beneficial mutations
	compete with one another and, thereby, interfere with the expected
	progression of a given mutation to fixation. From theoretical exploration
	of such 'clonal interference', we have derived (1) a fixation probability
	for beneficial mutations, (2) an expected substitution rate, (3)
	an expected coefficient of selection for realized substitutions,
	(4) an expected rate of fitness increase, (5) the probability that
	a beneficial mutation transiently achieves polymorphic frequency
	(> or = 1\%), and (6) the probability that a beneficial mutation
	transiently achieves majority status. Based on (2) and (3), we were
	able to estimate the beneficial mutation rate and the distribution
	of mutational effects from changes in mean fitness in an evolving
	E. coli population.},

	(CTVT) is thought to be the tumor cell itself. To test this hypothesis,
	we analyzed genetic markers including major histocompatibility (MHC)
	genes, microsatellites, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in naturally
	occurring tumors and matched blood samples. In each case, the tumor
	is genetically distinct from its host. Moreover, tumors collected
	from 40 dogs in 5 continents are derived from a single neoplastic
	clone that has diverged into two subclades. Phylogenetic analyses
	indicate that CTVT most likely originated from a wolf or an East
	Asian breed of dog between 200 and 2500 years ago. Although CTVT
	is highly aneuploid, it has a remarkably stable genotype. During
	progressive growth, CTVT downmodulates MHC antigen expression. Our
	findings have implications for understanding genome instability in
	cancer, natural transplantation of allografts, and the capacity of
	a somatic cell to evolve into a transmissible parasite.},

  abstract = {There is a large body of theoretical studies that investigate factors
	that affect the evolution of virulence, that is parasite-induced
	host mortality. In these studies the host population is assumed to
	be genetically homogeneous. However, many parasites have a broad
	range of host types they infect, and trade-offs between the parasite
	virulence in different host types may exist. The aim of this paper
	is to study the effect of host heterogeneity on the evolution of
	parasite virulence. By analyzing a simple model that describes the
	replication of different parasite strains in a population of two
	different host types, we determine the optimal level of virulence
	in both host types and find the conditions under which strains that
	specialize in one host type dominate the parasite population. Furthermore,
	we show that intrahost evolution of the parasite during an infection
	may lead to stable polymorphisms and could introduce evolutionary
	branching in the parasite population.},

  abstract = {Using a previously undescribed approach, we develop an analytic model
	that predicts whether an asexual population accumulates advantageous
	or deleterious mutations over time and the rate at which either process
	occurs. The model considers a large number of linked identical loci,
	or nucleotide sites; assumes that the selection coefficient per site
	is much less than the mutation rate per genome; and includes back
	and compensating mutations. Using analysis and Monte Carlo simulations,
	we demonstrate the accuracy of our results over almost the entire
	range of population sizes. Two limiting cases of our results, when
	either deleterious or advantageous mutations can be neglected, correspond
	to the Fisher-Muller effect and Muller's ratchet, respectively. By
	comparing predictions of our model (no recombination) to those of
	simple single-locus models (strong recombination), we show that the
	accumulation of advantageous mutations is slowed by linkage over
	a broad, finite range of population size. This supports the view
	of Fisher and Muller, who argued in the 1930s that progressive evolution
	of organisms is slowed because loci at which beneficial mutations
	can occur are often linked together on the same chromosome. These
	results follow from our main finding, that distribution of sequences
	over the mutation number evolves as a traveling wave whose speed
	and width depend on population size and other parameters. The model
	explains a logarithmic dependence of steady-state fitness on the
	population size reported recently for an RNA virus.},

  abstract = {Germ-line mutations (present in all cells) in genes that are crucial
	for the cell cycle cause cancer only in specific cell lines (e.g.
	mismatch repair genes in the colon; BRCA1-2 in breast and ovary;
	other cancers in Bloom syndrome, neurofibromatosis and xeroderma
	pigmentosum). The mutation rate of genes other than mismatch repair
	or p53 is the same in colon cancer and in normal cells, indicating
	that a 'mutator phenotype', increasing the rate of mutations in many
	genes, is not an essential feature of sporadic cancers; conversely,
	fusion genes, TEL-AML1/AML1-ETO, typical of leukemia, are 100 times
	more frequent at birth than in overt leukemia in children, indicating
	that further selective events are needed to cause malignancy. The
	devastating impairment of immunity, as in AIDS patients, does not
	cause cancer other than Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
	although immunological control is considered to be an essential mechanism
	in preventing the spread of cancer cells. These observations suggest
	that cell-specific additional events are needed to explain carcinogenesis.
	Carcinogenesis has been traditionally interpreted as the sequence
	of initiation (mutation) and promotion (clone expansion), with an
	interesting similarity with the neo-Darwinian theory of evolution,
	based on a first stage of genetic change (including recombination)
	and a second stage of selection. I propose that carcinogenesis consists
	in two general phases (not necessarily stages), i.e. genetic change
	followed by clone expansion (selective advantage). As in neo-Darwinian
	theory selection is chiefly represented by the elimination of the
	less fit, the selection of mutated cells would mainly consist in
	resistance to apoptosis or other types of 'bottlenecks' that hamper
	a cell's survival; an example of such a bottleneck is the autoimmunity
	that induces paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in individuals with
	PIG-A mutations. Cancer rates show great variation in different countries
	around the world, a variation only marginally explained by genetic
	differences. More interestingly, migrants change their risk of cancer
	by adapting to that of the population into which they move: as these
	changes are not likely to be entirely due to mutagens in the environment,
	we have to invoke selective pressure over mutated cells to explain
	them. My theory is that mutated cells adapt to environmental 'niches'
	better than normal cells, in a 'gene-environment interaction' that
	involves the history of the genetic changes the cell has undergone
	and the kind of environment in which it happens to live.},

  abstract = {Carcinogenesis, at least for some types of cancer, can be interpreted
	as the consequence of selection of mutated cells similar to what,
	in the theory of evolution, occurs at the population level. Instead
	of considering a population of organisms, we can refer to a population
	of cells belonging to multicellular organisms. Many carcinogens are
	mutagens, and the observed geographic distribution of cancer is,
	at least in part, attributable to environmental mutagens. However,
	the rapid change in risk for some cancers after migration suggests
	that carcinogenesis involves--in addition to mutations--some late
	event that most probably consists of the selection of cells already
	carrying mutations. We review a few examples of such selective pressures:
	finasteride in prostate cancer, vitamin supplementation in smokers,
	acquired resistance to chemotherapy, peripheral resistance to insulin,
	and sunlight and mutations in melanoma. A disease model for such
	a hypothesis is represented by Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria
	(PNH). Mutations can be present at birth, as in the case of PNH,
	and can have a frequency much higher than the occurrence of the corresponding
	disease (PNH or lymphocytic leukaemia in children). However, PNH
	does not require a mutator phenotype, only a mutant phenotype followed
	by selection. A characteristic feature of cancer, instead, is likely
	to be the development of the mutator phenotype. We propose a 'Darwinian'
	model of carcinogenesis. If the model is correct, it suggests that
	prevention is more complex than avoiding exposure to mutagens. Mutations
	and genetic instability can be already present at birth. Mutations
	can be selected in the course of life if they increase survival advantage
	of the cell under certain environmental circumstances. In addition,
	gene-environment interactions cannot be interpreted according to
	a simplified linear model (based on the 'analysis of variance' concept);
	experimental work suggests that a more comprehensive non-linear interpretation
	based on the idea of 'norm of reaction' is needed.},

  abstract = {The many immunological observations and results from in-vitro or in-vivo
	experiments vary, and their interpretations differ enormously. A
	major problem is that within a normal distribution of biological
	phenomena, which are measurable with many methods, virtually anything
	is possible. Within a coevolutionary context, the definition of biologically
	relevant thresholds is an important key to improve our understanding
	of weaknesses and strengths of the immune system. This review is
	a personal view, comparing textbook rules and experiments using model
	antigens with observations on immunity against infections or tumors
	to critically evaluate our perception and understanding of specificity,
	affinity maturation, antigen presentation, selection of the class
	of the immune response, immunological memory and protective immunity,
	positive selection of T cells and self/nonself discrimination.},
