\section{Software}
This section lists software created as a result of this research project. All experimentation in this dissertation were achieved using the OAT platform with customised extensions.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \emph{IIDLE: Immunologically Inspired Distributed Learning Environment}: IIDLE is based in a holistic abstraction of the acquired immune system as a spatially distributed, circulating and heterogeneous population of specialised discrete units that provide a homogeneous defence against external pathogenic material. It is these discrete, atomic, immutable and disposable units or information packets that represent the knowledge captured by the system, and are the substrate for the maintenance and learning processes. Includes Java implementation, with applets, user interface, and optimisation experiments. See \cite{Brownlee2006} and download the software from \url{http://www.ict.swin.edu.au/personal/jbrownlee/iidle/index.html} or \url{http://jason.brownlee05.googlepages.com}.	
	\item \emph{WEKA Classification Algorithms}: A collection of plug-in algorithms for the WEKA machine learning workbench including Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms and Artificial Immune System (AIS) algorithms. Algorithms include Learning Vector Quantisation (LVQ), Perceptron, Back-Propagation, Self-Organising Map (SOM), Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS), and the Clonal Selection Algorithm (CLONALG). Download the software from: \url{http://wekaclassalgos.sourceforge.net}.
	\item \emph{Optimisation Algorithm Toolkit (OAT)}: A workbench and toolkit for developing, evaluating, and playing with classical and state-of-the-art optimisation algorithms on standard benchmark problem domains; including reference algorithm implementations (Java), graphing, visualisations and much more. Algorithms include Evolutionary, Swarm, Immune System and others. Domains include Continuous Function, Travelling Salesman, Protein Folding and others.
