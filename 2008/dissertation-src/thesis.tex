% Guideline: 
% Generally, should be no longer than 100,000 words (ideally 50K-80K words)

% Guideline: Grammatical Tense
% All general discussions and all discussions of experiments, equipment, etc. are written in the past tense
% References to mathematical formulae (and objects) are written in the present tense 
% References to future work are also written in the past tense

% APPENDICES

% Guideline:
% Appendices should contain supplementary material that the author considers necessary to the interpretation of the text itself. 
% Long tables, essential raw data, detailed reports or computer are generally more appropriately included in an appendix. 
% Appendices should not be longer that the body of the thesis and normally would be considerably shorter. 
% If there is more than one appendix, the appendices should be numbered in sequence using Arabic numerals.

% Guideline:
% Appendices are used to store important calculations, proofs, tables or code which would interrupt the flow of qualitative descriptions in the body of the thesis.  

% Guideline: the appendices should be no more than 10-20% of the size of the main body of the thesis

  % change chapter name and counters (eg Chapter 1 -> Appendix A)
