<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The field of Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) is interested in using
immunology as an inspiration for computation paradigms. Predominantly the work
in this field has been focused on devising and analysing algorithms inspired by
specific immunological theories. The
Immunological Inspired Distributed Learning Environment (IIDLE) is an artificial
immune system that exploits the inherent parallelism, decentralised control, and
spatially distributed nature of the learning behaviours of the mammalian
acquired immune system. It is a platform or framework for distributed learning
tasks that (among many other features) can have immunological and other
algorithms embedded within it.</p>

<p>This page provides a brief description of the conceptual model that underpins
IIDLE, as well as a number of case study application scenarios with
demonstration software and downloadable source code. The hope is that both the
ideas and practical implementation of IIDLE be made accessible and generate
interest, comment, and perhaps facilitate the extension of this area of
research. Peer-reviewed publications and technical reports on the IIDLE platform
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070830043236/http://www.ict.swin.edu.au/personal/jbrownlee">are available</a>. If you are interested in
discussing the IIDLE platform or potential collaboration or experiment ideas
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070830043236/http://www.ict.swin.edu.au/ictstaff/jbrownlee/">please contact me</a>.</p>

<h2>Conceptual Model of IIDLE</h2>

    <p>IIDLE is based in a holistic abstraction of the acquired immune system as
    a spatially distributed, circulating and heterogeneous population of
    specialised discrete units that provide a homogeneous defence against
    external pathogenic material. It is these discrete, atomic, immutable and
    disposable units or information packets that represent the knowledge
    captured by the system, and are the substrate for the maintenance and
    learning processes. </p>

    <i>Conceptualisation of the clonal expansion theory as a triggered
    population based learning system</i></p>
    <p>Using this population based abstraction of the acquired immune system,
    the intent in developing the IIDLE platform was to devise an AIS that was
    distributed and decentralised from the ground up. The following were the
    principle design goals for developing the platform in the context of the
    immunological model:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Context Specific Learning</b> -
      <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">from an
      initial generic starting point, the system is capable of tuning its
      performance to the specific environment or domain to which it is applied.</span></li>
      <li><b>Self-Regulated Resource Maintenance</b> -
      <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">internal
      processes exist within the system to govern the allocation and
      de-allocation of resources in response to the context specific
      requirements of the system (such as in response to external input and
      bounding space complexity).</span></li>
      <li><b>Decentralised Control</b> -
      <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">the internal
      maintenance processes of the system are localised and self-governing, not
      requiring a master controlling process.</span></li>
      <li><b>Triggered Adaptation</b> -
      <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">the system
      modification required when learning occurs in response to an externally
      introduced trigger defined by the context or environment in which the
      system is situated.</span></li>
      <li><b>Robustness and Fault Tolerance</b> -
      <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">there is an
      inbuilt lack of dependence and reliance on specific discrete components of
      the system. This is permitted by architectural and functional redundancy,
      which facilitates the continued system operation in response dynamic
      component failure or removal.</span></li>
    </ol>

    <i>A Conceptualisation of the distributed immunological architecture showing
    locality connectivity, external stimulation, and internal activation</i></span></p>

    <h3>Architecture</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><i><b>Localities</b></i> -
      The continuous nature of the vascular and lymphatic systems that provide
      the migration pathways for lymphocyte cells is discretised&nbsp; into distinct
      localities (not unlike island populations) that are connected together in
      some network topology facilitating the inherent mobility of units. A
      locality abstract provides both an interface and scope at which to apply
      local (decentralised) processes, as well as a transient storage location
      for discrete units.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b><i>Tail</i> </b>- A
      locality supports a population structure called a tail that stores a
      number of discrete units for a given time. The structure is called a tail
      given the manner in which it is depicted diagrammatically. The locality
      and tail are differentiated for conceptual modularity where the physical
      storage data structure for units can be changed and reconfigured
      independently of the locality and its associated governing and maintenance
      processes.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><i><b>Units</b></i> - A
      tail contains a number (zero or more) units at any given time during the
      simulation. Each unit is a discrete information packet meaningful in the
      context of the specific problem domain to which IIDLE is being applied
      (such as a permutation, real number variables, etc... and an associated
      quality scoring).</span></li>
    </ol>

    <i>Overview of the IIDLE architecture showing localities, tails, and units</i></span></p>

    <h3>Processes</h3>
    <p>The system is simulated in discrete time intervals and processes
    represent the algorithmic component that operates upon the discrete unit
    substrate in the context of a specific problem application. Processes are
    confined to a locality and can be implemented as either independent threads
    of execution or executed in aggregate sequentially by a single thread at a desired scoping of localities. </p>
    <ol>
      <li><b><i>Movement Process</i> </b>- Movement is the process of removing
      units from the tail of one locality and adding them to the tail of a
      neighbouring locality. This unit migration facilitates the mobility of the
      knowledge learned by the system thus facilitating the redundancy of units
      and general robustness of the architecture.</li>
      <li><i><b>Decay Process</b></i> - The decay process is designed to manage
      the size of the unit population, specifically in response to the creation
      of new units by the proliferation strategy of the expansion process. Each
      unit has a finite energy which is initialised upon unit creation, and it
      is the task of the decay process to decrement unit energy and discard
      those units that deplete all assigned energy. There are two approaches to
      this decay process that have been implemented - conformer homeostasis
      (blind uniform decay) and regulator homeostasis (seek scoped global energy
      equilibrium).</li>
      <li><i><b>Expansion Process</b></i> - Core to the design principles of the
      expansion process is the conceptualisation of external stimulation (input)
      that triggers the internal adaptation (learning) processes of the system.
      The stimulation of a locality may be implemented as the provision of
      computation time (such as execution of an objective function), provision
      of memory resources (such as extension and exploration of a state space),
      or access to a limited resource (such as database records in a mainframe).
      The expansion process is loosely based upon the clonal expansion
      principle, although it is modularised into three discrete steps which must
      be selected in the context of a specific application domain; a <i>
      stimulation</i> strategy, a <i>selection</i> strategy (for selecting
      useful units), and a <i>proliferation</i> strategy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Philosophy (Vision) for IIDLE</h2>
    <p>The vision or philosophy for IIDLE is that of an ever-present or
    always-on system distributed across the internet on a decentralised P2P
    substrate. The knowledge of the system is captured by the discrete units (as
    discussed in the system architecture), although in this vision the units
    only exist in machines that are apart of the system. Hosts check-in and
    check-out of the system in an ad-hoc manner increasing and decreasing the
    knowledge capacity as well as the processing power of the system. Units flow
    through the network in an autonomous manner, and the hosts of the system
    selectively filter the units they are interested in, and selective
    contribute units to the flow.</p>
    <p align="center">
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
    <img border="0" src="/web/20070830043236im_/http://ict.swin.edu.au/personal/jbrownlee/iidle/p4.jpg" width="284" height="170"><br>
    <i>Depiction of the vision of IIDLE as a network platform showing ad-hoc
    connection of clients, and the differing contributions of clients (producing
    units, consuming units, and both)</i></span></p>
    <p>In practical terms the ever-present nature of the system provides an
    alternative to the configure-run-analyse cycle of conventional search and
    optimisation tasks. The scale of the implementation provides the capability
    to address conventional optimisation as well as collaborative optimisation at a
    level rarely discussed, let alone attempted (thousands or tens of thousands
    of clients). It is this ability to capture
    and harness human intervention to machine-learning tasks on a large scale I
    think that provides the most interesting application of this technology.</p>
    <p>The following points summarise this vision of the IIDLE as an internet
    machine-learning
    platform:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&quot;<i>always-on</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>ever-present</i>&quot; internet-based
      optimisation</li>
      <li>hosts tap into this ever-present information stream, filtering and
      contributing as they will</li>
      <li>both autonomous and human-interactive interfaces are provided into the
      information stream</li>
      <li>the human-interactive interfaces facilitate problem-specific
      collaboration at various levels of expertise such as &quot;<i>technique expert</i>&quot;,
      &quot;<i>domain expert</i>&quot;, &quot;<i>interested novice</i>&quot;, etc.</li>
      <li>on smaller scales (local area network) the system provides a viable
      alternative to the conventional approach to applied optimisation (the
      configure-run-analyse cycle)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Basic Optimization</h2>
    <p>IIDLE is capable of addressing canonical optimisation problems such as
    the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), Function Optimisation (funcopt) and
    Protein Folding (HP Model). For this scenario IIDLE is run on a single
    machine with a number of localities. Stimulation of units equates to
    evaluation against an objective function, and proliferation is one of three
    simple optimisation approaches; Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO),
    and Random Search. </p>
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="/web/20070830043236im_/http://ict.swin.edu.au/personal/jbrownlee/iidle/iidle1.JPG" width="240" height="180"><br>
    <i>A graphical display in the IIDLE architecture showing units in
    various different states</i></p>
    <p>This first IIDLE scenario (basic optimisation) demonstrates an important
    IIDLE principle, that of an always-on and human interactive search process.
    The problem domains are relatively easy to solve as they were selected to
    demonstrate these important and foundational principles of the IIDLE
    platform. A stop condition has not been set for the simulations permitting
    the user complete and real-time control over the progression of the simulation.
    Real-time feedback is provided in the form of line graphs and
    problem-specific graphics to permit the user to gauge impact of various
    configurations on the simulation.</p>

	<h2>Multiple Objective Optimization</h2>
    <p>For the application of IIDLE to optimisation problem domains, the
    objective function is implemented as stimulation to the system at the scope
    of localities. Using multiple different objective functions is implemented
    as multiple different stimulation strategies which can be configured to
    trigger adaptation in the system in a uniform (all stimulation strategies
    operate across all localities) or in a partitioned (scoped) manner (localities are
    divided between the stimulation strategies). The latter partitioned approach
    results in interesting implicit niching effects, and thus is used as a
    default configuration in the following TSP and function optimisation
    examples.</p>

    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>There are many domains and experiments I want to try with IIDLE, the
    following lists some of the more interesting ideas for future work and
    preliminary work that has already been completed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Classification</b> - A version of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)
      has been embedded into IIDLE and successfully addressed toy classification
      problems. The full potential of IIDLE as a dynamic classification system
      has not been realised. My hope is to investigate IIDLE's capabilities as a
      <i>novelty detection</i> or <i>anomaly detection</i> system.</li>
      <li><b>Implicit Problem Decomposition (Views)</b> - This was an idea to
      further exploit the collaborative search capabilities of IIDLE by having
      each client operate upon a different subset (<i>view</i>) of the problem.
      In effect this results in an implicit and scalable divide-and-concur
      approach to optimisation. Preliminary results have been achieved with
      function optimisation with views implemented as sub-hypercube of the
      parameter space.</li>
      <li><b>Large-Scale Collaborative Optimisation</b> - I am very interested
      to investigate the systems capabilities on a suitable optimisation problem
      on a <i>medium-scale</i> (one or two computer labs of clients) and on a <i>
      large-scale</i> (the internet). The problems I see are firstly the
      selection of a suitable domain, and then ensuring the software (novice
      users) and API (users writing their own clients) provide enough flexibility to address
      the domain.</li>
      <li><b>Collaborative Filtering Application</b> - There may be some
      potential for IIDLE to be used as a collaborative filtering system. Again
      the first issue is the selection of a suitable problem domain.</li>
    </ul>

<h3><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: 400">The software was written in
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070830043236/http://www.java.com/">Java</a> 1.5 (5.0), and was written to be
highly-modular and extensible. Thus it is relatively trivial to include
additional processes, strategies and problem definitions. The software also uses
a number of open-source libraries (provided in the offline download); <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070830043236/http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/index.php">

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<p>Ask me questions, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070830043236/http://www.ict.swin.edu.au/ictstaff/jbrownlee/">contact me</a>.</p>

<p><b>Q</b>. Why is it so slow when adjusting the total number of localities in the
system?<br>
<b>A</b>. There is a threading concern - the simple fix is to pause the system when
changing the total localities, then un-pause after the configuration change.</p>

<h2>To-Do</h2>

<p>The following are features I would like to add to this software over time, as
well as user-requested features that I'd like to include (time permitting):</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>UserFeedback</b>: allow pause, stop, start functionality to work
        on the user feedback panel</li>
        <li><b>UserFeedback</b>: provide a user-stimulation control panel to
        adjust speed of cycle</li>
        <li><b>UserFeedback</b>: the speed of the simulation with human feedback
        is very slow</li>
        <li><b>Usability</b>: configure each scenario for optimal performance</li>
        <li><b>Usability</b>: improve the usability of the system control panel
        (sliders and such)</li>
        <li><b>Stimulation</b>: provide the ability to dynamically re-define
        stimulation partitions</li>
        <li><b>Stimulation</b>: allow the user to select different stimulation
        strategies (TSP - all three)</li>
        <li><b>Algorithms</b>: support multiplication and addition modes when
        there is a heuristic component in ACO</li>
        <li><b>Algorithms</b>: support PSO in the GUI</li>
        <li><b>Movement</b>: support different movement types (unidirectional,
        greedy, random)</li>
        <li><b>Network</b>: write boot list on exit</li>
        <li><b>Network</b>: support proxies</li>
        <li><b>Network</b>: provide a panel to show network connectivity
        (neighbours)</li>
        <li><b>Network</b>: check for port already in use, and use new port
        (multiple clients on one box)</li>
        <li><b>Network</b>: provide capability for the user to adjust the number
        of portals per neighbour</li>
        <li><b>Network</b>: support network configuration from within an applet</li>
    </ul>
